# Overview of VC valuation methods
## 1. Traditional valuation methods

### 1.1 Venture capital, quantitative, pre- and post-revenue
The venture capital method is a firm valuation based on the target rate of return of the VC. The VC's ownership position, the expected investment time-frame and estimated final valuation at exit are the parameters of the assessment (Barrell et al., 2013). With these assumptions the initial discounted price which the VC should invest can be determined.

### 1.2 Book value, quantitative, pre- and post-revenue
The book value is the net worth of all tangible assets of the company and counts all assets which could be liquidated in the short-term (Koller et al., 2015).

### 1.3 Liquidation value, quantitative, pre- and post-revenue
The liquidation value method is comparable to the book value method, and also measures tangible assets. However, if all the inventory was sold on bulk, the achievable sales value is lower than the book value (Koller et al., 2015).

### 1.4 Replacement value, quantitative, pre- and post-revenue
Replacement value method, also called “sweat equity” method, is the hypothetical cost to employ the management team since the incorporation of the venture. The underlying assumption of this method is that an experienced team of founders worked on a project and it would cost as much to rebuild the current stage of the ESV with other employees (Mothersill, 2009).

### 1.5 Discounted cash flow, quantitative, post-revenue
Predicting the future operating cash flow profile and discounting it with a risk factor yields the discounted cash flow. Aggregating and discounting the value for the predicted investment horizon gives the present valuation of the investment (González Jiménez and Pascual, 2008; Jennergren, 2008). Depending on the investment stage, widely utilised discount factors have been established (Holloway et al., 1999; Koller et al., 2015).

### 1.6 Net present value, quantitative, post-revenue
The net present value is similar to the discounted cash flow but subtracts the the costs of the initial investment. Consequently, a positive net present value suggests that the earnings will exceed the costs (Koller et al., 2015).

### 1.7 First Chicago, quantitative, post-revenue
Starting basis is a similar procedure to the discounted cash flow method, but First Chicago weighs different scenarios according by multiplying with their probability of occurrence. Common practice is to calculate the expected values for a best, medium, and worst case scenario (Achleitner and Lutz, 2005).

## 2. Non-traditional valuation methods

### 2.1 Berkus, qualitative, pre-revenue
ESVs are evaluated by five criteria: sound idea, prototype, quality of management team, strategic relationships, and
product roll-out or sales. The assessed company can score up to $500k for each criterion, hence be valued up to $2.5m (Berkus, 2009; Sahlman and Scherlis, 1987).
<hr>

### 2.2 Risk factor, summation  qualitative, pre-revenue
Starting point is the valuation of an ESV in a comparable sector and region. Value is added or subtracted for twelve risk-criteria. A very low perceived risk adds $500k and a low risk $250k in value. Very high and high risks subtract the same amount respectively. The criteria assess the management team, stage of business, legislation/politics, manufacturing, sales, funding and capital raising, competition, technology, litigation, reputation, and exit opportunities (Berkus, 2009; Sahlman and Scherlis, 1987).

### 2.3 Scorecard valuation, qualitative, pre-revenue
As for the risk factor summation, the valuation starts by determining the average historic pre-money valuation of ESVs in the same target industry and geographical region. Depending on industry and region, seven weighted criteria are evaluated. These criteria are: the strength of the management team 30\%, size of opportunity 25\%, product and technology 15\%, competitive environment 10\%, marketing, sales channels, partnerships 10\%, need for additional investment 5\%, and "other" 5\%. The ESV performance is assessed in each of the categories compared to the norm (100\%). Under-achieving performance is discounted with up to 75\%, over-achievement is rewarded with a factor of up to 150\%. An aggregated weighting-factor is obtained by multiplying weight and respective ESV performance of each category. The value is multiplied with the average firm valuation which was obtained in the beginning and gives the final valuation (Payne, 2011).

### 2.4 High-tech start-up, valuation, qualitative and quantitative, pre-revenue
25 multiple choice, qualitative and quantitative questions are evaluated in the high-tech start-up valuation method. The underlying analysis is not disclosed by the developer of the tool (Cayenne Consulting, 2015).

### 2.5 Comparable transactions, quantitative, pre- and post-revenue
A comparable reference company ![ref.comp](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=ref.comp) has to be determined. By comparing the reference company's key metrics to its achieved valuation, the valuation for another to be evaluated company ![eval.comp](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=eval.comp) can be found as follows: ![\frac{ref. comp valuation}{ref. comp metric} = \frac{eval. comp valuation}{eval. comp metric}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cfrac%7Bref.%20comp%20valuation%7D%7Bref.%20comp%20metric%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Beval.%20comp%20valuation%7D%7Beval.%20comp%20metric%7D). Various metrics such as revenue, earnings, EBITDA, and book value apply (Campbell, 2003).
